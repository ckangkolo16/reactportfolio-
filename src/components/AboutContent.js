        Hi, My name is Chobu Kangkolo and I was born in Cameroon, West Africa. I
        have lived in the United States for about 20 years and i've spent the
        majority of that time here in Kansas City, Missouri. I have also lived
        in Texas, Maryland and Georgia but of all those places, I prefer
        Missouri.I am experiencing the joys of being a father to my 6 month old
        daughter Eliora and when i'm not with her I am either playing video
        games, drawing or working out. I am an avid an sports fan so much so
        that I fall asleep to Sportcenter. When I have the time, I love taking
        pictures around the city and binge watching documentaries on netflix.{" "}

      <p className="lead">
        From time to time, I challenge myself to master new ideas and to learn
        more about my different interests. One of those interests which could
        possibly reap great rewards if mastered are computers. I am currently
        taking a break from my undergrad program at NWMSU to learn coding skills
        which could hopefully make me desirable in the growing tech world. You
        can follow me and my progress here.
